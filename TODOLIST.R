# New set-up:
#   Latex2html only does the html step, not the escape step
#   Write mb routine 
#   add mb to maketestquiz
#   make library
#   disentange aidfunctions and other cores in separate files
#   Check everywhere that sampling from a scalar is the scalar, and not a random number 1...int(scalar)
#   iAlt in answer_select works incorrectly, if I give 7, it gives 8 options plus noneoftheabove
